  I remember walking* 'round the court square sidewalk, lookin' in windows at things I couldn't want.
There's Johnson's hardware and Morgan's jewelry, and the ol' Lee King's apothecary.
They were the little man. I go back now and the stores are all empty, except for an old coke sign from 1950s.
They are boarded up like they never existed, or renovated and called historic districts. There goes the little man.
Now the court square's just a set of bricks* that the people pass* but they seldom think about the little man that made* this town before the big money shut em down.
He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass. One violent*, rainy night he fixed your flat. The new stores came where you do it yourself, and you buy a movie* and computer* off the shelf.
  He hung on there for a few more years, but he couldn't sell slurpees and he wouldn't sell his dignity*.
Now the bank rents the station to a man down the road and they sell real estate*  and cars*.
There goes little man. Now the stores are lined up in a concrete strip, and you can buy the whole world in just one trip.
You save a penny cause it's jumbo size, but they don't realize they're killing the little man.
